# Kubernetes spikes

This repository holds experiments designed to gain greater understanding of the inner workings of kubernetes. You may use this code for any purpose, but no warranty is provided.

Type `./gradlew run` to run all experiment. Each experiment has its own task name, generated dynamically from the experiment package name. i.e., `experiments.x001pod` can be run by typing `./gradlew runX001pod` (note the uppercase X.)
